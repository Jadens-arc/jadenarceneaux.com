My focus throughout my professional life has been enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. It has a certain charm to it. Some of the projects are proprietary and confidential and others are open-sourced. These are just the highlights of everything I've worked on. To get a more comprehensive look at my code feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jadens-arc).

  - Over **20,000 downloads** so far :D
  - This started as a joke. It was just me wanting to dip my toes into the world of ownership-model memory management and Rust as a whole. I ended up making something that is pretty robust and something I'm proud of.

  - A platform for writers to share ideas and opinions
  - Written in PHP using the Symfony framework
  - Hosted on Google Cloud
  - Made shortly after I graduated high school. My hobby of journaling turned into a full obsession with writing. It started off with me writing one-off album reviews when I was in class but evolved into me wanting to share them with the world. I wanted to make a platform for writers, that didn't focus on viewer retention and addiction. There's a lot more lore to this one [you can read it here](/posts/what-is-opium-press/)
- **[Penny](https://github.com/jadens-arc/Penny)** - 2021-22
  - AES256 encrypted journaling desktop app
  - Written in Javascript using Electron
  - During the pandemic, I got super into journaling but I always had a fear of someone reading my journal. This was the solution. This was also around the same time I started taking data privacy seriously and built my first Linux desktop machine.
