## Overview

Experienced Full Stack Developer specializing in scalable applications, automation, and business process optimization (ERP, CRM, etc). Proven track record of leading high-impact projects and improving operational efficiency.

Personally, programming has been my passion for a big part of my
life. I taught myself my first programming language at 13 and
instantly became hooked.
