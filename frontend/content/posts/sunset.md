This sunset isn't super spectacular but the vibrant colors in contrast to the sea of black are so eye-catching. There's something so beautiful about sunsets. Laying a day to rest so you can wake up to take on another.

Yes, I was flying spirit and it went surprisingly well. Also, I met a nice lady on the plane and she showed me a picture of her dog so shout out to Jessica and her dog.
