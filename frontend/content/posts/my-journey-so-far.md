In my relatively short time on Earth and even shorter time in my career, I've had a pretty wild journey. Hopefully, someone finds this useful or inspiring in some way. More than anything, I hope this gives future developers some perspective.

**What I wanted to be growing up**

- Garbage man (ages 0 - 5)
- Neurologist (10 - 13)
- Cinematographer (For like 2 months in middle school)
- Programmer (13 - âˆž)

I think I've always had a fascination with understanding how things work. My favorite show as a kid was How It's Made. Giant garbage trucks with their gargantuan robot arm amazed me. The unknown expanse that is the brain made me so curious. Cameras aren't that complicated, but they are strange and their metrics and inner workings are wonderfully unintuitive, especially if you're used more to traditional technology.

Computer code was all those things to me and more. Most importantly, it was accessible; it was something I could just do. You can't drive a garbage truck without a license and you can't cut a person's head open without a few licenses, but you can make an app anytime, anywhere, regardless of who you are. So, I just jumped straight in.

## Middle School

> Me in middle school lmao

When I was in 6th grade, I got my first taste of programming using an app called Hopscotch. It was a simple drag-and-drop code blocks app for iPads (I didn't have a computer at that time). I spent so much of my free time making games and random projects. By the time I was in 8th grade (13 years old), I decided that programming seemed a lot more fun than Neurology and it was an equally viable career path. So, I decided to learn my very real first programming language.

Apple's Swift was my language of choice. Not because I wanted it to be, but because all I had was my iPad, and Swift Playgrounds seemed familiar and novel at the same time. I didn't get super deep into the world of iOS development. I spent most of my time just getting used to the fundamentals. I learned about control flow, variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.

Before I knew it, I was a freshman in high school.

## High School

### What's a Magnet School

Let's take a step back for a second.

I don't know how applicable these terms are to people who grew up in different school systems, but in Las Vegas, the whole city is in one county with one school district. During my time in school, students had what was called their zoned school, which is the school they'd be assigned to based on proximity. Under certain circumstances, you could go to other schools around the city. My middle school was a "magnet school" which is a public school could apply to get into regardless of where you lived in the city. Magnet schools have magnet programs, and my specific program area was Biomedicine. I also did Video Production on the side, which really exposed me to a lot of cool tech.

After finishing middle school, I applied to a couple of magnet high schools. I ended up getting into Advanced Technologies Academy (A Tech for short) which is the number one ranked high school in the state. My program area at this time was Computer Science, which meant I was required to take college-level computer science courses my whole way through high school.

### Freshman Year

In my freshman year of high school, I was in my first AP Computer Science class. Here I learned JavaScript. Honestly, most of it was a repeat of what I had learned in Swift, but I finally had full projects to work on. Most of our coding was done on [Code.org](https://code.org). This taught me the fundamentals of structuring a project. Halfway through the school year, I received an HP Chromebook, my first laptop. I convinced my parents I needed it for school, which was mostly true. The very first thing I did with it was install Linux on it. To this day, there is a video on my YouTube channel from around that time where I explain how to get Linux on a Chromebook. This unlocked a whole new world for me. No longer was I bound to the limits of my iPad. I could install new languages and new libraries, and make entirely new projects. I also started learning the fundamentals of the command line and absolutely fell in love with it. The only downside was that it was too slow to run any kind of GUI-based text editor but with Vim by my side, I was ready to take on anything.

### Summer One

The summer after, I took it upon myself to learn Python because I saw a Michael Reeves video. To this day, Python is one of my favorite languages. I made some really fun projects that summer. That was also around the time when I first got on GitHub and started publishing them for the world to see. My biggest project by far up to that point was [Scripty](https://github.com/Jadens-arc/Scripty), a text editor completely written in Python, so I wouldn't have to solely rely on Vim.

### Sophomore Year

During my sophomore year of high school, we were required to learn Java. This is where the real learning starts. This is also where I met one of the most important people in my progression as a software developer, Mr. Mayo.

That year, I learned what Object-Oriented Programming was. I also learned recursion, basic algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and merge sort), and time/space complexity. This was the first time I was doing any real problem-solving and trying to find the optimal solution.

Around this time my dad got super into gaming. I convinced him he should get a gaming PC to be better at the games he enjoyed. That led to me and him building our first computer together.

Then the pandemic happened...

### Summer Two

Around this time, I heard some wise advice. Constantly switching programming languages was going to slow down my progression as a programmer. I decided to hone my skills in the languages I already knew, primarily Python and JavaScript. Honestly, I can't remember a single notable other thing from this summer; the pandemic was a blur.

### Junior Year

I spent this entire year doing online school. This, by far, was my best year academically. I genuinely enjoyed this year more than any other year leading up to it. All of my classes were hosted using Google Meets. Some people had spreadsheets to manage all the links; I had a web app hosted on my Raspberry Pi that updated a hyperlink using a socket connection depending on the time of the day. I could change my schedule by modifying a JSON file that specified the name, start, end, and url of each class. That was just the start. I also got really into journaling at this time, and I made an AES-256-bit encrypted journaling app using Electron called Penny. And I made a crazy amount of smaller projects to fill the time at home alone.

I also had a rather fun run-in with AI that you can read about in my [racist robots](/posts/racist-robots) post.

Also, my parents finally decided I could upgrade my computer. Rather than buying something off the shelf, they gave me a budget to buy parts to build a computer. I built my first desktop for myself and promptly installed Linux on it. That's still my desktop to this day.

### Senior Year

Finally being back to school IRL, my main focus at this point was college. So rather than focusing solely on building new projects, I decided to take on some extracurriculars. Alongside Mr. Mayo, I started tutoring Computer Science, which was a joy. I also got my first job at that time at a battery store that also fixed phones. Learning how to fix phone screens and replace their batteries was the most interesting aspect of the job for me. Also, just learning about the sheer number of batteries out there was crazy; there isn't a battery I haven't seen.

I led a project in my Computer Science class to build a cryptocurrency for the school. We were given four computers by the school to act as nodes in the blockchain, and I even got to give the class a little lesson on Linux. Based on Cardano, we eventually got a small prototype working. This project was later shut down by higher-ups at the school because legally creating a cryptocurrency requires tons of paperwork and documentation. With it being a public school, the legalities of everything became very overwhelming very fast.

I got into this really great cybersecurity class. My school had a full server room lab for the students to experiment with, and this year we decided to completely revamp it. I got to disassemble multiple server racks and conduit lines and replace them with much-updated hardware.

I also worked on a project alongside two of the other prolific Linux users in the class to refurbish and install Linux on 36 old computers to give them away to students. I got to pick the distro and I decided on Elementary OS. I picked it because, being a fork of Debian, it has excellent support resources and is very stable while also being very approachable and user-friendly.

## Beyond

Towards the end of the school year, I caught wind of an internship opportunity from Mr. Mayo. He recommended me for the internship, and shortly after graduating, I started my internship at ISP.Net. My plan at this point was still to go to college and get my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science but after two months of the internship, I got a job offer for a full-time position. I unenrolled from college and the rest was history.

After getting this job, I chose to live with my parents for another year to save money. Shortly after turning 18, I was able to buy my first home. Now I'm 19. I've been a full-time software developer for two years now and a homeowner for a year.

The main thing I hope people take away from this is just to genuinely enjoy programming. Make things that you enjoy and things that interest you. It might be slow but over time (Ken Carson reference) things will pick up. Hopefully, my story will be helpful or inspiring to some future developer and give them a useful roadmap for planning their career.
