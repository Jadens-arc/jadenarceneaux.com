Let's get straight to it. Most of this tech isn't "new" it's just new to me and maybe new to many of you. 

## My Priorities

- **Cross-platform support**
    - I have an iPhone, a de-googled Android phone, a MacBook that I take everywhere, a Windows PC for gaming, and a Linux Desktop that I work on. Everything I use needs to 
- **Privacy**
    - I really do care about my data privacy. If my data doesn't have to be out there then it shouldn't. So open-sourced and end-to-end encryption are the name of the game.

## [Massgrave](https://massgrave.dev/)

I don't know why everyone doesn't use this tool. It lets you activate your installation of Windows completely for free and change your Windows version at a whim (Pro, Home, etc). All with one command in the Command Prompt. I haven't paid for a Windows key in years (I am definitely lying and I totally 1000% pay for Windows). It's literally the best

## [Filen](https://filen.io/)

Filen is an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage provider. What makes Filen special to me is its pricing options. Unlike other providers that require you to pay month to month, they offer lifetime, pay-once pricing. I paid $23 for 200 gigabytes for life. It's been a great solution for backing up important files.

## [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/)

Obviously you can never be too secure and I usually locally encrypt my files before uploading them to any cloud storage provider. Cryptomator has been the best solution for making encrypted vaults full of files. What I like most about them is their cross-platform support (iPhone, Mac, Android [including de-googled Androids using F-Droid], Windows, and Linux)

## [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.com/)

Literally the only note-taking app I use. I journal every day and previously I used to fill up an entire notebook in 2-3 months before I switched to journaling digitally. If you can't tell by now, I love to write. The thing I love about it the most is that, unlike the built-in notes app on iPhones, it's completely end-to-end encrypted with free cloud storage and it's open-sourced so anyone can validate their security and privacy claims. It's honestly the only notes app I use. And it's 100% cross-platform (it's a React Native app). Beyond that, it's just a genuinely good note-taking app. You can customize the color themes, categorize your notes into folders, and even use rich text editing with markdown syntax if that's the kind of guy you are. I actually write almost all of these blog posts in Standard Notes and it's wonderful. 

## [1Password](https://1password.com/)

By far the biggest change in my daily tech stack this year was switching password managers. For the past 4 years, I've been using a password manager called KeePassXC. An open-sourced password manager that stores everything in a local vault. I'd use an FTP server on my local network to host the vault file and a VPN server to access my home network on the go. The result was an incredibly secure and private password-managing experience. And also a constant nightmare of debugging, file saving conflicts/collisions, slow load times, and no support for autofilling passwords. So this year I made a switch. I exported all my passwords as a CSV and imported them to 1Password. Truth be told, it's been amazing. The autofill functionality alone has been amazing.  I love how it runs in the background with an incredible command pallet for searching for passwords. I love how it integrates with passkeys for one-click sign-in on so many websites. I love how I'm able to unlock it with biometrics on my phone and on my Mac.
