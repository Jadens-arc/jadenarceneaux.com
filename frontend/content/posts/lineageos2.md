Figured I'd make a follow-up to my original post and go into more detail about my experience using LineageOS.

## What's on my Device
I feel like MKBHD right now lmao. First things first I'd like to make clear what *isn't* on my device. Closed-sourced and proprietary software. The very first qualification an app must meet to get my stamp of approval is being open-sourced. I want to be able to go through each line of code on my own and know that I'm not being tracked. Even if you don't know how to code, opting for open-sourced software is still a smart decision. You can trust that hundreds of other developers have gone through the code to ensure its safety and privacy.

**My Essential Apps**
- **F-Droid** An open-sourced alternative app store.
- **Tor Browser** My web browser of choice and I also have Firefox as a fall-back if a website doesn't support Tor
- **Tuta** My encrypted email client of choice
- **OpenKeychain** Managing my PGP keys, signing messages, and encrypting/decrypting files
- **Standard Notes** Lowkey one of my favorite note-taking apps. It's encrypted and very well thought out. Although the cloud sync stuff isn't something I'd personally spend money on.
- **Keepass2Android** KeepassXC is the only password manager I rely on. I love it because it's based around local files, not cloud syncing. This is just a great KeepassXC client for Android.
- **Mulvad** Great VPN. I'd trust it more than other VPNs, especially because they accept alternative forms of payment (you can mail them cash, send gift cards, or use Monero). This sounds like an ad :(
  - If you can I'd recommend self-hosting your own VPN using Wiregard but I just didn't feel like doing all that

**Bonus**: The launcher I'm using is called [EasyLauncher](https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/EasyLauncher).

## What do I actually use it for
Disconnecting. Getting away while still being reachable for the people that matter. Also journaling. There are times where I want to write things with zero chance of anyone other than me reading them. This phone is perfect for that.
