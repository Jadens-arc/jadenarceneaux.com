Somehow, I have miraculously become the guy to ask for investment advice in my family, so this is the amalgamation of all my thoughts. If you're not my relative or something tangential, this doesn't apply to you.

> Note: I'm not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice

## Investing in general

Maybe this is a hot take, but I think that most forms of short-term investing are basically gambling. This includes day trading and Forex trading.

The truth (or at least my truth) is that time in the market beats timing the market. Rather than trying to buy investments that'll turn you into an overnight millionaire, you should focus on long-term, consistent growth. This is slow and boring, but it's also low risk. Buying short-term, highly volatile stocks is a great way to lose all of your money very quickly. Once you start combining that with options trading or stock shorting, you've found a great way to ruin your present and your future.

### Just be boring

Stick to S&P 500 index funds and real estate if you can afford it. Also, don't invest everything you have. It's important to have diversity in your portfolio, and part of that is remaining at least partially liquid. Keep putting money into your savings account and try to get a high-yield savings account if possible.

## Crypto

Okay, out of any form of "investing," I think I'm most qualified to speak on crypto. I had the chance to do a college course from CSN all about crypto when I was in high school. After that, I led a project to build a cryptocurrency from scratch for my school's student store (which was later shut down for legal reasons). I've mined Bitcoin. To this day, I have multiple crypto wallets. I know Solidity and I've built Merkle trees. And I can say with confidence that you shouldn't invest in any cryptocurrency, and viewing cryptocurrencies as investments is inherently incorrect.

### Where do cryptocurrencies come from

The concept was first realized with the creation of Bitcoin in 2009, by an individual or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. This digital currency utilized technology called blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers. The emergence of Bitcoin set the stage for the development of numerous other cryptocurrencies, each with their unique features and purposes. Cryptocurrencies originated from the need to establish a decentralized and secure form of digital currency, free from central bank control. They were created to replace traditional currency altogether, not be an investment accessory to it.

Cryptocurrencies are absolutely amazing for privacy and democratizing the concept of currency as a whole. By definition, they aren't overseen by any government or governing body. There are no banks or institutions monitoring every transaction. Which is why they are great for privacy, autonomy, and anonymity. Even on this very website, in the [misc](/misc) tab, you can find my Monero public address for sending me donations anonymously.

## The Risks of Crypto

But you should be able to tell by now that there is a glaring risk involved with cryptocurrencies. There's no safety net. You better trust yourself 1000% to never make a mistake. Because there is no recovery process, there's no support hotline, there isn't a bank you can go to for help. If you get scammed, there is nothing you can do about it. There is little to no real fraud protection other than your ability to keep your passwords and secret keys hidden.

Cryptocurrencies are unsecured (this does not mean insecure), there is no real asset behind any coin. When you invest in a home there is an underlying asset, land and the physical structure of your home. While yes you can absolutely lose money in real estate it's unlikely that the value will reach zero. There is no limit or protection for how much money you can lose in any cryptocurrency.

There's also the fact that cryptocurrencies are an inherent threat to the Federal Government. The last thing the Federal Government wants is to lose the ability to track everyone's purchases, and there has been real pushback on the adoption of cryptocurrencies nationwide. In China, cryptocurrencies have been illegal since their inception.

### Climate

By no means am I a climate activist but to put it plainly, cryptocurrencies are insane for the environment. The carbon footprint and electricity consuption of Bitcoin alone is comparable to the entire country of Sri Lanka and it consumes more energy than the entire gold mining industry. There have been massive efforts to cut down the power consumption of certain blockchains but this is yet another reason why mass adoption of crypto is unlikely.

### Volatility

Then there's volatility. Here's the S&P 500 over a 10-year span:

![s&p 500](https://i.imgur.com/OQbNQVi.png)

As you can see, there are definitely ups and downs, but there is a very consistent trend. And here is Bitcoin, the largest and most widely used cryptocurrency.

They both react to current events and the economic landscape but Bitcoin is far more volatile, being far more reactive to whatever's going on in the world. Bitcoin is subject to wild swings in price. This poses a much larger risk to any investors. This risk and volatility is only amplified when you look at smaller currencies.

There's a reason for that. Cryptocurrencies weren't designed for market stability, and they definitely weren't designed to be investment opportunities.

## The sheer number of scams

Anyone can make a crypto currency, I mean I did when I was in high school.

> Okay, this is a tangent, but the people in my family have way too much faith in false advertising laws. That hasn't been relevant since the 1900s. Especially on the internet, anyone can say anything about anything without repercussion.

Everybody wants you to think their cryptocurrency is the next big thing. That overnight you're going to magically 10x your money. And sometimes they're right. Very often celebrities will endorse a cryptocurrency to build its reputation and subsequently send its value to the moon. Then at the peak, they'll sell off all their coins. Instantly depreciating the entire market and allowing them to walk away with everyone's money. This is known as a pump-and-dump scheme and it's just one of many ways to get horrifically scammed using cryptocurrency. One day you might be a millionare and the very next you'll be completely broke.

## In Conclusion

To be clear, I have no problem with cryptocurrencies themselves. I think they are amazing for privacy and autonomy. I think people should absolutely have the right to use alternative currencies and live out their financial lives without being constantly monitored. But as an investment opportunity, they absolutely suck. This is a political tool, not a get-rich-quick scheme. You should be prepared to pay the price of that. If your goal isn't to make anonymous transactions removed from the watchful eyes of governments, banks, and financial institutions, then cryptocurrencies are not for you.
