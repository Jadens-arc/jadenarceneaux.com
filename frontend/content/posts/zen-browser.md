## Background

About a year ago I was put onto Arc browser. This funky remix of Chromium that moved all the tabs to the side and divided up login sessions into spaces. Long story short I loved everything about this browser except for the fact that it was closed source and based on Chrome.

Then it died. The company building it realized it wasn't making any money and they killed it. Which turned out to be the best thing in the world. Arc browser was so beloved by the community that almost immediately an open sourced, Firefox based, clone of it started development.


## The Zen Browser

Literally everything that was good about Arc and it's open sourced!


## Pinned Tabs

Unlike traditional browsers that have relatively ephemeral tabs that are meant to be closed, Zen prioritizes pinned tabs. These are meant to be websites that you open often. Things that you want to be only a click away. You can even organize them into named folders
