Obituary
Mahalia was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. She was the fourth child born to Albert and Ethel Franklin. She was introduced to Christ at a young age. ‘Cie’/Sistah’, as loved ones affectionately called her, spent her early life in the 9th ward of New Orleans, where she attended Author P. Williams grade school and McDonald 35 High School where she participated in marching band and had aspirations of becoming a math teacher. In years to follow she was united in matrimony to Robert Lee Anderson and to this union, they raised Vanessa and Bruce Anderson. In the 1960s Cie followed in the footsteps of her older sister Mary, relocated to Los Angeles, California, and became employed with the United States Postal Service. After 30 years of dedicated service to the post office, she retired in 2000. In 1980, she excitedly welcomed her first grandchild Jasmine Azzette Anderson and in 2003 she delightfully became the grandmother to Dalia Charlene Anderson. In 2004 she welcomed her great-grandson Jaden Kenneth Arceneaux. Her life after retirement afforded her the opportunity to relocate to Las Vegas, Nevada then to Maricopa, Arizona. In later years she enjoyed traveling to maintain constant contact with her family. She was never further than a phone call or a flight away from anyone at any given moment." />
