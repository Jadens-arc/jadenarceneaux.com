I feel like every one of my blog posts can be destroyed with the question &ldquo;who cares&rdquo;, this one is the epitome of that.
The Situation
I have a lot of food allergies. I&rsquo;m allergic to eggs, nuts, fruit seeds, and all seafood (including shellfish). I also don&rsquo;t eat red meat or pork. Not for any religious or health reasons, I just think they&rsquo;re kinda gross and they&rsquo;ve just never seemed appealing to me. So the only meats I eat are chicken and turkey. I also eat a lot of vegetables and pasta." />

<h2 id="the-situation">The Situation</h2>
<p>I have a lot of food allergies. I&rsquo;m allergic to eggs, nuts, fruit seeds, and all seafood (including shellfish). I also don&rsquo;t eat red meat or pork. Not for any religious or health reasons, I just think they&rsquo;re kinda gross and they&rsquo;ve just never seemed appealing to me. So the only meats I eat are chicken and turkey. I also eat a lot of vegetables and pasta.</p>
<p>Because of the egg allergy, I don&rsquo;t eat cake or cupcakes (birthdays can be tricky) but for whatever reason cookies are manageable. They still can occasionally make my throat pretty itchy but it&rsquo;s honestly so worth it. As long as I only have like one a day I&rsquo;m fine.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of salads however I have to be careful. Unbeknownst to most, Caesar dressing is usually made with anchovies which are a big no-go. Also, a lot of dressings love to sneak in nuts.</p>
<p>Mayonnaise can make my throat hurt if I eat enough of it but most mayo (especially the lower-quality store-bought stuff) doesn&rsquo;t use real eggs so it&rsquo;s okay. I usually just don&rsquo;t order mayo at nice restaurants to make sure I never get the real stuff.</p>
<p>What about ice cream? Strawberries (or any other fruits) are off the table. I don&rsquo;t know how I haven&rsquo;t mentioned this yet but I don&rsquo;t really like chocolate. I&rsquo;ve warmed up to it as I&rsquo;ve gotten older (I like ice cream sand witches and Oreos) but I still find it way too overpowering to eat on its own. Chocolate bars on their own taste way too strong for me to enjoy. So I don&rsquo;t like chocolate ice cream. Mint ice cream is just frozen toothpaste, I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone eats that shit. Vanilla bean makes my throat hurt enough for me to avoid it (vanilla bean is a fruit and the whole fruit seed thing). But French vanilla. French Vanilla? My first love. My baby. My twin flame. I love me some French vanilla ice cream. The biggest injustice in mankind ever is the prevalence, propagation, and proliferation of vanilla bean over French vanilla in society. I love, <strong>LOVE</strong>, going to small boutique ice cream shops and nothing pains me more than seeing a tub full of vanilla bean with no French vanilla in sight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seriously is getting to the point where I&rsquo;m going to start naming names, tagging toes, and leaving Yelp reviews</p></blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s all I eat and even more of what I don&rsquo;t. Funny enough I love trying new restaurants. If you ever want some great recommendations for chicken spots I&rsquo;m your guy.</p>
