  <time>Oct 21, 2024</time><span> | 3 Minutes</span><br><div class="description">
	
	First off I should say that I absolutely love my Tesla Model 3. It very well might be one of my favorite cars of all time and it&rsquo;s by far the best daily driver I could ask for.
It does have a few problems
Range Elon Musk Charging availability Elon Musk No Amazon Prime Video But by far the strangest problem is the air conditioning. It stinks. Like literally, Teslas are known to develop a smell after months of use and it&rsquo;s not just because the drivers don&rsquo;t shower.

	Despite what Google might advertise with Google Workspace, there is a free alternative to get a custom domain with Gmail. Although it does take some technical know-how
Receiving mail to a custom domain must be done before you can send mail from a custom domain
Receiving mail to a custom domain This is by far the easiest process
Go to whatever domain provider you have and configure email forwarding. Forward all emails going to a specific address to your Gmail address.

  <time>Aug 27, 2024</time><span> | 1 Minute</span><br><div class="description">
	
	Okay, I just wanted to write about this really cool little piece of tech magic I witnessed today. So I just went to Discount Tire to put some air in my tires. I happen to know for a fact that my tires are rated for exactly 42 PSI. At Discount Tire they have this little device that scans the tag in the door sill to read the car&rsquo;s recommended tire pressure. Then it sends that information to the air compressor to fill up the tires. When I looked at the air compressor I noticed that it read 45 PSI instead of 42. I was a little too shy in the moment to ask the attendant why there was a discrepancy but on the drive home, it hit me. Air expands as the temperature goes up and it’s a really hot day. That 42 PSI rating is meant for tires at room temperature. When I got home I did some quick math. It was 99° outside. Believe it or not, 45 PSI at 99° cools to almost exactly 42 PSI at room temperature (72°). This means that the little air compressor was taking into account the ambient air temperature and calculating a PSI offset when deciding how much air it should put in my tires. That’s so cool! I don’t know how common air compressors are that do that (I’ve never seen one) but it’s such a good idea. Whoever decided to put a thermostat on an air compressor was a fucking genius.

	AWS All assets site-wide have been moved to an AWS S3 bucket. This reduces the size of the repository and helps mitigate fragmentation with some assets previously being stored on Imgur.
Moving the whole site to AWS is still in consideration and may happen in the coming months. It will continue to be open-sourced for the remainder of its lifetime.
Supporting For anyone looking to support me as a writer and a developer, there is now a link on the misc tab to buymeacoffee.com. Credit cards and Apple Pay are supported. Also, shout out to Tyler who sent me $5. To be so for real you don&rsquo;t have to send me anything, this is mainly for people who really really like something I made. I don&rsquo;t expect you guys to pay my bills lmao.

	Figured I&rsquo;d make a follow-up to my original post and go into more detail about my experience using LineageOS.
What&rsquo;s on my Device I feel like MKBHD right now lmao. First things first I&rsquo;d like to make clear what isn&rsquo;t on my device. Closed-sourced and proprietary software. The very first qualification an app must meet to get my stamp of approval is being open-sourced. I want to be able to go through each line of code on my own and know that I&rsquo;m not being tracked. Even if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, opting for open-sourced software is still a smart decision. You can trust that hundreds of other developers have gone through the code to ensure its safety and privacy.

	Don’t take this post seriously, this is just me being goofy and having fun.
Some Background Recently, I embarked on a mini project. It started with my boss giving me her old OnePlus 8. Conveniently, the very next day the battery in my iPhone 11 Pro Max decided it wanted to see the world and pushed the screen off my phone. This meant that for the next two days, I got to become an Android user for the first time in almost 10 years.

	This sunset isn&rsquo;t super spectacular but the vibrant colors in contrast to the sea of black are so eye-catching. There&rsquo;s something so beautiful about sunsets. Laying a day to rest so you can wake up to take on another.
Yes, I was flying spirit and it went surprisingly well. Also, I met a nice lady on the plane and she showed me a picture of her dog so shout out to Jessica and her dog.

  <time>May 8, 2024</time><span> | 3 Minutes</span><br><div class="description">
	
	TL;DR Tkinter - GUI&rsquo;s Pyautogui - mouse and keyboard automation Flask - web servers Why Obligatory Yap Session There&rsquo;s one unifying aspect to each of these libraries: conciseness. Throughout my time writing Python, I&rsquo;ve learned that what matters isn&rsquo;t just ease of use. It&rsquo;s about getting straight to the heart of a problem and directly crafting a solution. Good Python code is the direct manifestation of an idea, not a technical document. It might not be the best tool for teaching the low-level aspects of computer science or crafting intricate, efficient systems, but it is excellent for quickly bringing an idea to life and iterating on it. Python is the Swiss Army knife of computing, and these are some useful accessories to keep in your back pocket.
