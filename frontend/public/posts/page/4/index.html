	While on a quest to have the best Neovim setup possible, I hit a roadblock.
For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, I have a 2020 M1 MacBook Air. For as long as I&rsquo;ve had a Mac, I&rsquo;ve been using the default terminal application. It&rsquo;s not the best, but it&rsquo;s cute enough, and it does most of what I need it to do. But it has one fatal flaw. It doesn&rsquo;t support true colors. Which means it doesn&rsquo;t work with the majority of Neovim themes.

	For the past two years, I&rsquo;ve been doing photography as a hobby. I have an amazing Canon M200 that I love taking pictures on. Not only does it take beautiful, vibrant, 24-megapixel photos but it also captures all that information almost completely uncompressed using Canon&rsquo;s raw format. The only downside is that it generates so much data and requires so much storage. The issue of storage has been ongoing. It started with me using Google Photos, but then they changed their pricing model to not offer free unlimited storage. Then I put everything on a one-terabyte Samsung T7 SSD (yes I know about the read/write limitations of SSDs). Then I got a Western Digital MyCloud and the hard drive crashed (thank god for that SSD). Unfortunately, I still lost some photos and Western Digital discontinued the product a few months later. So I&rsquo;ve been in this purgatory. I have a lot of old pictures in Google Photos and a lot of new ones on my SSD. Neither places seem particularly stable so I&rsquo;ve started working on something that will hopefully be better.

	I know no one cares about my dotfiles. That&rsquo;s not going to stop me from sharing them.
Download init.vim
Installation Install Neovim Install Vimplug Make sure you have the latest version of NodeJS installed Some package managers(apt) won&rsquo;t install the latest version by default I&rsquo;d recommend installing NVM (Node version manager) Then run nvm install --lts After installing the dependencies and coping the init.vim file run : PlugInstall in command mode For language server support run : CocInstall &lt;server-name&gt; To see a full list of language servers go here For Python install coc-pyright For C/C++ install coc-clangd For HTML install coc-html For CSS install coc-css For Javascript install coc-tsserver For Rust install coc-rust-analyzer For code snippets run : CocInstall coc-snippets Note: Rust analyzer has issues compiling for M1 macs.

	What is Brainfuck It&rsquo;s an Esolang (Esoteric Programming Language). These languages are designed to be as hard to read and write as possible. They&rsquo;re mostly jokes but they are also a very useful tool for learning the absolute fundamentals of computer science.
Brainfuck works by performing operations on a Turing machine. It has 8 main instructions
+ Increment current cell by one ‚àí Decrement current cell by one &gt; Move to the right cell &lt; Move to the left cell . Print current cell casted to ASCII character , Get character input from user [ Start a loop ] End a loop When the instruction parser reaches the ] it will check the value of the current cell. If the value of the current cell pointed at by the head is zero then the program flows like normal on to the next instruction. If the value is anything other than zero then the instruction parser will jump back to the start of the loop indicated by the [.

	The shallow answer is a social media platform written in PHP using the Symfony framework. It&rsquo;s hosted using the Google Cloud Platform in a single VM instance. The production database is MariaDB.
But that still leaves the question of why it exists.
I made it with the intent of having a place to publish my music reviews and allow other people to publish whatever else they wanted to write. By far I&rsquo;m the most active on my Instagram which isn&rsquo;t convenient for posting large blocks of text but by having Opium.Press I can share a single link

	Just got this thing set up. I&rsquo;m not going to lie it was kinda a pain in the ass. That&rsquo;s mostly my fault though because of how I approached things. I saw this theme and I really liked it so I wanted to use it. The only problem was that my only experience with GitHub pages was from years ago and I didn&rsquo;t really like it. Revisiting it after so long was&hellip; jarring, to say the least, and adjusting to new deploy tools like Hugo was surely something.
