Cross-platform support

I have an iPhone, a de-googled Android phone, a MacBook that I take everywhere, a Windows PC for gaming, and a Linux Desktop that I work on. Everything I use needs to


Privacy

I really do care about my data privacy. If my data doesn&rsquo;t have to be out there then it shouldn&rsquo;t. So open-sourced and end-to-end encryption are the name of the game.

<h2 id="filen"><a href="https://filen.io/">Filen</a></h2>
<p>Filen is an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage provider. What makes Filen special to me is its pricing options. Unlike other providers that require you to pay month to month, they offer lifetime, pay-once pricing. I paid $23 for 200 gigabytes for life. It&rsquo;s been a great solution for backing up important files.</p>
<h2 id="cryptomator"><a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a></h2>
<p>Obviously you can never be too secure and I usually locally encrypt my files before uploading them to any cloud storage provider. Cryptomator has been the best solution for making encrypted vaults full of files. What I like most about them is their cross-platform support (iPhone, Mac, Android [including de-googled Androids using F-Droid], Windows, and Linux)</p>
<h2 id="standard-notes"><a href="https://standardnotes.com/">Standard Notes</a></h2>
<p>Literally the only note-taking app I use. I journal every day and previously I used to fill up an entire notebook in 2-3 months before I switched to journaling digitally. If you can&rsquo;t tell by now, I love to write. The thing I love about it the most is that, unlike the built-in notes app on iPhones, it&rsquo;s completely end-to-end encrypted with free cloud storage and it&rsquo;s open-sourced so anyone can validate their security and privacy claims. It&rsquo;s honestly the only notes app I use. And it&rsquo;s 100% cross-platform (it&rsquo;s a React Native app). Beyond that, it&rsquo;s just a genuinely good note-taking app. You can customize the color themes, categorize your notes into folders, and even use rich text editing with markdown syntax if that&rsquo;s the kind of guy you are. I actually write almost all of these blog posts in Standard Notes and it&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<h2 id="1password"><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></h2>
<p>By far the biggest change in my daily tech stack this year was switching password managers. For the past 4 years, I&rsquo;ve been using a password manager called KeePassXC. An open-sourced password manager that stores everything in a local vault. I&rsquo;d use an FTP server on my local network to host the vault file and a VPN server to access my home network on the go. The result was an incredibly secure and private password-managing experience. And also a constant nightmare of debugging, file saving conflicts/collisions, slow load times, and no support for autofilling passwords. So this year I made a switch. I exported all my passwords as a CSV and imported them to 1Password. Truth be told, it&rsquo;s been amazing. The autofill functionality alone has been amazing.  I love how it runs in the background with an incredible command pallet for searching for passwords. I love how it integrates with passkeys for one-click sign-in on so many websites. I love how I&rsquo;m able to unlock it with biometrics on my phone and on my Mac.</p>
