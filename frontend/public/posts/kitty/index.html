			<p>While on a quest to have the best Neovim setup possible, I hit a roadblock.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, I have a 2020 M1 MacBook Air. For as long as I&rsquo;ve had a Mac, I&rsquo;ve been using the default terminal application. It&rsquo;s not the best, but it&rsquo;s cute enough, and it does most of what I need it to do. But it has one fatal flaw. It doesn&rsquo;t support true colors. Which means it doesn&rsquo;t work with the majority of Neovim themes.</p>
<p>Initially, I tried to ignore it and just go with one of the few themes that supported the default terminal. But the allure of a truly beautiful Neovim setup was too strong, so I gave in.</p>
<p>Trying out <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">Kitty</a> initially was underwhelming. Just felt like any other terminal. Things really opened up to me the moment I hit <code>command + ,</code> to see the settings. I was greeted by pages of configs launched in Vim instead of a dedicated GUI. Upon reading the documentation, I was even more surprised.</p>
<ul>
<li>The window management is lovely and truly a strong competitor with Tmux.</li>
<li>The CLI, kitten,  that comes with Kitty is extremely helpful
Built-in support for downloading, previewing, and installing themes is so handy</li>
<li>The fact that I can easily change the app icon to something other than the ugly default one is amazing</li>
<li>and I can match my terminal theme to Neovim theme :D
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin">catppuccin</a> on top!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did encounter one issue with it not working correctly with NCurses. I&rsquo;m not sure what exactly caused this. The application I was trying to use was an application I wrote so it very well could be my fault. But it was easily resolved by modifying the <code>kitty.config</code> and setting <code>term xterm-256color</code>.</p>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m using Neovim inside Kitty to write this blog post and I have to say it&rsquo;s very smooth, very responsive, and overall just looks beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jadenarceneaux.com/neovim.webp" alt="Image of my setup"></p>
<p>The ability to natively split windows is so handy for having an editor window open and my server logs and other notes off to the side.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m impressed. If you&rsquo;re a Mac user who regularly uses the terminal, I&rsquo;d highly recommend giving Kitty a try.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes I know a lot of this is &ldquo;rice&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s nice and it brings me joy</p></blockquote>
