All assets site-wide have been moved to an AWS S3 bucket. This reduces the size of the repository and helps mitigate fragmentation with some assets previously being stored on Imgur.
Moving the whole site to AWS is still in consideration and may happen in the coming months. It will continue to be open-sourced for the remainder of its lifetime.
Supporting
For anyone looking to support me as a writer and a developer, there is now a link on the misc tab to buymeacoffee.com. Credit cards and Apple Pay are supported. Also, shout out to Tyler who sent me $5. To be so for real you don&rsquo;t have to send me anything, this is mainly for people who really really like something I made. I don&rsquo;t expect you guys to pay my bills lmao." />
