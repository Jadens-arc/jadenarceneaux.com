What&rsquo;s on my Device
I feel like MKBHD right now lmao. First things first I&rsquo;d like to make clear what isn&rsquo;t on my device. Closed-sourced and proprietary software. The very first qualification an app must meet to get my stamp of approval is being open-sourced. I want to be able to go through each line of code on my own and know that I&rsquo;m not being tracked. Even if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, opting for open-sourced software is still a smart decision. You can trust that hundreds of other developers have gone through the code to ensure its safety and privacy." />

<h2 id="whats-on-my-device">What&rsquo;s on my Device</h2>
<p>I feel like MKBHD right now lmao. First things first I&rsquo;d like to make clear what <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> on my device. Closed-sourced and proprietary software. The very first qualification an app must meet to get my stamp of approval is being open-sourced. I want to be able to go through each line of code on my own and know that I&rsquo;m not being tracked. Even if you don&rsquo;t know how to code, opting for open-sourced software is still a smart decision. You can trust that hundreds of other developers have gone through the code to ensure its safety and privacy.</p>
<p><strong>My Essential Apps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F-Droid</strong> An open-sourced alternative app store.</li>
<li><strong>Tor Browser</strong> My web browser of choice and I also have Firefox as a fall-back if a website doesn&rsquo;t support Tor</li>
<li><strong>Tuta</strong> My encrypted email client of choice</li>
<li><strong>OpenKeychain</strong> Managing my PGP keys, signing messages, and encrypting/decrypting files</li>
<li><strong>Standard Notes</strong> Lowkey one of my favorite note-taking apps. It&rsquo;s encrypted and very well thought out. Although the cloud sync stuff isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d personally spend money on.</li>
<li><strong>Keepass2Android</strong> KeepassXC is the only password manager I rely on. I love it because it&rsquo;s based around local files, not cloud syncing. This is just a great KeepassXC client for Android.</li>
<li><strong>Mulvad</strong> Great VPN. I&rsquo;d trust it more than other VPNs, especially because they accept alternative forms of payment (you can mail them cash, send gift cards, or use Monero). This sounds like an ad :(
<ul>
<li>If you can I&rsquo;d recommend self-hosting your own VPN using Wiregard but I just didn&rsquo;t feel like doing all that</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: The launcher I&rsquo;m using is called <a href="https://github.com/DroidWorksStudio/EasyLauncher">EasyLauncher</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-actually-use-it-for">What do I actually use it for</h2>
<p>Disconnecting. Getting away while still being reachable for the people that matter. Also journaling. There are times where I want to write things with zero chance of anyone other than me reading them. This phone is perfect for that.</p>
