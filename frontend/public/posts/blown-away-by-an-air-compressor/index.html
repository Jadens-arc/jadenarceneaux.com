I happen to know for a fact that my tires are rated for exactly 42 PSI. At Discount Tire they have this little device that scans the tag in the door sill to read the car&rsquo;s recommended tire pressure. Then it sends that information to the air compressor to fill up the tires. When I looked at the air compressor I noticed that it read 45 PSI instead of 42. I was a little too shy in the moment to ask the attendant why there was a discrepancy but on the drive home, it hit me. Air expands as the temperature goes up and it’s a really hot day. That 42 PSI rating is meant for tires at room temperature. When I got home I did some quick math. It was 99° outside. Believe it or not, 45 PSI at 99° cools to almost exactly 42 PSI at room temperature (72°). This means that the little air compressor was taking into account the ambient air temperature and calculating a PSI offset when deciding how much air it should put in my tires. That’s so cool! I don’t know how common air compressors are that do that (I’ve never seen one) but it’s such a good idea. Whoever decided to put a thermostat on an air compressor was a fucking genius." />
