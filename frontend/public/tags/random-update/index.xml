      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing The Sims a lot. Outside of Minecraft I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a gamer but this game has really gripped me. The last time I played a Sims game I was in elementary school and it was on my 3DS. For some reason I find myself enjoying it much more now than I ever did. There&amp;rsquo;s probably some depressing observation about the burden of adulthood and escapism of fantasy to be had but I&amp;rsquo;m not that philosophical. Big shout out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@carynandconniegaming&#34;&gt;CaryandConnieGaming&lt;/a&gt; for appearing in my YouTube recommendations and catalyzing my latest hyperfixation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made a one-to-one replica of my condo in the game. I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of it. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to take my word for it though because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to post the exact floor plan of my home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
