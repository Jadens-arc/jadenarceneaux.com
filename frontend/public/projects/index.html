ISP.Net - Primarily used PHP with the Symfony framework

Lead Management System

Help track and nurture potential clients


HR Information System

Managed sensitive employee personal information
Automated Onboarding, Suspension, and Offboarding

Integration with Google, Active Directory, and Kazoo to streamline




Access Control System

Badge and Kiosk system
Monitored employee and visitor movement throughout multiple data centers
Integrated with the timecard system to verify clock-in/clock-out times


Billing System

Integrated with various payment processors
Managed recurring and one-time payments for both internal billing and clients using the portal
Integrated with infrastructure to streamline setup for new clients and enforce suspensions for overdue accounts


Client Relationship Management System

Tracked interactions and communications with clients
Optimize customer support-client interactions


Refactored and rewrote thousands of lines of legacy code


Ironmind - 2024

Esoteric Language interpreter and code execution visualizer.
Written in Rust and available on crates.io, snap, and homebrew
Over 20,000 downloads so far :D
This started as a joke. It was just me wanting to dip my toes into the world of ownership-model memory management and Rust as a whole. I ended up making something that is pretty robust and something I&rsquo;m proud of.


Juniel Enterprises

Designed landing page
Provided consultation for billing systems

With consideration for scalability, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness




Opium.press - 2022-23

A platform for writers to share ideas and opinions
Written in PHP using the Symfony framework
Hosted on Google Cloud
Made shortly after I graduated high school. My hobby of journaling turned into a full obsession with writing. It started off with me writing one-off album reviews when I was in class but evolved into me wanting to share them with the world. I wanted to make a platform for writers, that didn&rsquo;t focus on viewer retention and addiction. There&rsquo;s a lot more lore to this one you can read it here


Penny - 2021-22

AES256 encrypted journaling desktop app
Written in Javascript using Electron
During the pandemic, I got super into journaling but I always had a fear of someone reading my journal. This was the solution. This was also around the same time I started taking data privacy seriously and built my first Linux desktop machine.
